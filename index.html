        <h1>Project On Console</h1>

        <p> Visual Studio is an offline platform where you can code. To set it up, you need to download it in Microsoft. Once done, create a folder and open it in VSC. Happy coding.
        </p>

        <p> The Console screen is used to display mostly mathematical factors like 2 + 2. The answer(4) will be in the console screen. To open it up, you need to Inspect and then press "Console" in the top. Make sure you are pressing the one ontop. The print stuff in the console, we use a JavaScript code. We do "console.log()" If we want to print stuff in the console screen. We type what we want to say in the parenthesis but if we want to put a string we have to use quotation marks. If we want to store a variable, we don't need quotation marks</p>
